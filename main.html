    <p class="policy">      AI is becoming more and more advanced in every passing second. Soon AI will be able to solve almost any
        problem such as maths and even music and art, things once considered to be impossible for machines to imitate.
        And who hasn’t watched a movie like Terminator or The Matrix and thought: “what if?”. Regulating AI has a fine
        line. On one hand, AI is helping progress research and improving the quality and efficiency of everyday things.
        But on the other, AI has a fallout effect on some people. The Brookings Institution predict that 36 million jobs
        in the US, 25% of U.S. employment, will be under higher risk of automation by 2030 using currently available
        technology. With this in mind, where is the boundary? If with modern technology there is a high risk of a
        quarter of all jobs being lost to AI what would the effect of future technologies be? Because of this, we are
        setting out a policy which will limit the replacement of jobs by AI. The policy will mean that AI cannot
        outright replace workers in tertiary and primary jobs, with secondary jobs being the exception. In secondary
        jobs, AI usage will be safer and more efficient, however we will still limit job replacement to 5% a year as a
        maximum up to 70% of all work, as we still want the opportunity for some workers who cannot move to other jobs
        to keep theirs. AI is very useful, and so instead of replacing jobs it can supplement work and improve
        efficiency in all sectors. Low wage jobs are most susceptible to being replaced by AI, and so the government
        money which is saved by the replacement of human workers with machines ones will be moved to a new benefits
        system which will be used to support workers who have been replaced by AI until they can find a job or a period
        of 1 year passes. We do not want to limit the abilities of AI in most ways. The more advanced AI that appears
        in the future the more we can progress as a society. We wish to limit military AI, however there is no guarantee
        that other countries will not do the same. A UN passed law of no military AI progression can be discussed,
        however China and Russia especially will not want to oblige, and so for now military AI will not be limited.</p>
